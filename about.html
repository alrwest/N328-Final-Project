      <h2>Visualizing Information | Final Project</h2>
      <p class="about">
        For my final project for N328, I used Kaggle to find a dataset with
        sufficient attributes. I debated for a while on whether to choose a more
        serious or a more fun dataset. After browsing Kaggle, I found a dataset
        that could answer an economic question about an entertaining topic. The
        chosen dataset shows the sale of PlayStation 4 games the regions of
        North America, Europe, Japan, and a sum of the rest of worlds sales.
        With the recent arrival of the PlayStation 5, an important question in
        the world of gaming is “what genre is the best-selling?” However, a more
        specific question I would also like to answer is “what genre is the
        best-selling in each region?” I believe this dataset can be turned into
        an interactive visualization that depicts that information.

      <p class="about">
        These answers could help publishers future software sales. The video
        game market in each region is unique. By knowing which genre sells best,
        publishers can focus on making video games that consumers truly want.
        Different genres include action, shooter, action-adventure, sports, and
        role-playing games. During this design process, I initially used Tableau
        to visualize the data. The attributes found in the set include the game
        title, the publisher, the year it was released, the sales of the three
        largest video game markets (North America, Japan, and Europe), and the
        sales of the rest of the world collectively. To create my visualization,
        I needed to use the genre, North American sales, European sale, Japan
        sales, and the rest of the worlds sales attributes. I felt the easiest
        way to convey the information learned would be to use a bar graph. Color
        conventions for each regions sales needed to be distinct and easy to
        view. I decided on red for Japan, blue for North America, green for
        Europe, and grey for the rest of the world.
