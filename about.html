      <h2>Visualizing Information | Final Project</h2>
      <p class="about">
        For my final project for N328, I decided to create a bar chart with HTML, CSS, and the d3.js library. I decided to choose a dataset (from Kaggle) based off one of my favorite pastimes and a continuously growing part of the entertainment industry: video games! I also work full-time at a video game store, so I was curious to see the game sales of the PlayStation 4, one of the most recent best-selling consoles (and one of my personal favorites.) 
      </p>
      <p class = "about">
        Out of the entire dataset, I was mostly interested in seeing which genres are the best-selling. Knowing what genres are most popular is important because game developers can use that data to know what kind of games to make to make the most profit and provide the most entertainment.
        <br>
        I decided to separate the data into two more csv files to show the top-ten best-selling genres in the North American region in comparison to the Japan region. Based off of the chart generated, with titles like “Call of Duty”, its not surprising that the “shooter” genre reigns at the top of the charts. “Action” and the “sports” genres are next, followed by “RPG” genre, and so on. “Racing” and “Platformers” seem to be down in popularity in recent years.
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        To summarize, these answers could help publishers future software sales. The video
        game market in each region is unique. Because each region is unique, it influenced me to compare two of the top regions: North America and Japan. By knowing which genre sells best,
        publishers can focus on making video games that consumers truly want.
    
        <p class="about">
        During this design process, I initially used Tableau
        to visualize the data. The attributes found in the set include the game
        title, the publisher, the year it was released, the sales of the three
        largest video game markets (North America, Japan, and Europe) and the
        sales of the rest of the world collectively. To create my visualization,
        I needed to use the genre, North American sales, Japan
        sales, and the genre attributes.
